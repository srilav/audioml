        "The primary objective of time series analysis is to develop mathematical models that provide plausible descriptions for sample data. In order to provide a statistical setting for describing the character of data that seemingly fluctuate in a random fashion over time, we can assume a time series can be defined as a collection of random variables indexed according to the order they are obtained in time. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we may consider a time series as a sequence of random variables, $x_1, x_2, x_3, . . . ,$ where the random variable $x_1$ denotes the value taken by the series at the first time point, the variable $x_2$ denotes the value for the second time period, $x_3$ denotes the value for the third time period, and so on. In general, a collection of random variables, $\\{x_t \\}$, indexed by $t$ is referred to as a stochastic process. Here, $t$ will typically be discrete and vary over the integers $t = 0, ±1, ±2, ...,$ or some subset of the integers. The observed values of a stochastic process are referred to as a **realization** of the stochastic process."
